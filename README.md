# leet-code-tracking

This repository is my personal workspace for exploring algorithmic problems from LeetCode. It holds iterative solutions, experiments, and notes captured while practicing data structures, dynamic programming, and other problem-solving techniques.

## Goals
- Build and maintain a disciplined routine for solving coding challenges.
- Track progress by committing iterations and refinements over time.
- Document insights, alternative approaches, and follow-up ideas for future review.

## Working With The Code
- Each module focuses on a single problem and may contain helper functions, brute-force drafts, and optimized revisions.
- Solutions are written with readability in mind; inline comments highlight non-obvious logic or trade-offs.
- Feel free to clone the repository and run any script directly with `python3` while adjusting input data as needed.

## Practice Workflow
1. Select a problem and sketch an initial strategy or brute-force solution.
2. Implement, test with sample inputs, and iterate toward cleaner or faster versions.
3. Capture key lessons learned (edge cases, patterns, optimizations) in code comments or future commits.

## Notes
- The repository evolves continuously; older entries may later receive updates as new techniques are learned.
- No binaries or dependencies are committedâ€”only source files and lightweight drivers for quick experimentation.
- Feedback and suggestions for alternative approaches are welcome via issues or pull requests.
